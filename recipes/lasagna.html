        <h3>A Home-Made Lasagna</h3>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong> : This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong> : You’ll need four large (peeled and sliced) tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bacon</strong> : Cooked, drained, and chopped bacon lends meaty flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Green Onions</strong> : Green onions add a bright pop of flavor and color.  </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong> : Shredded Cheddar cheese makes the lasagna extra indulgent.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles</strong> : Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
    </ul>
